<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/contrib/cluster-sharding.html" target="_blank">Akka cluster Sharding</a>
is useful when you need to distribute actors across several nodes in the cluster and want to
be able to interact with them using their logical identifier, but without having to care about
their physical location in the cluster, which might also change over time.
</p>

<p>
It can be actors representing Aggregate Roots in Domain-Driven Design terminology.
These actors typically have persistent (durable) state, which can be implemented with
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/scala/persistence.html" target="_blank">Akka Persistence</a>.
</p>

<p>
Cluster sharding is typically used when you have many stateful actors that together consume
more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine. If you only have a few stateful actors
it might be easier to run them on a 
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/scala/contrib/cluster-singleton.html" target="_blank">Cluster Singleton</a>
node.

<h2>The Blog Post Actor</h2>

<p>
To illustrate the cluster sharding feature we will use a small blog post application.
To make it easy to understand it has limited capabilities, and that also makes it possible for
you to get your hands dirty by adding more functionality as suggested in the end of the tutorial.
</p>

<p>
Open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post.scala</a>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Post</code> is an actor representing an individual blog post, i.e. we will create a new
<code>Post</code> actor instance for each new blog post. The actor is using 
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/scala/persistence.html#Event_sourcing" target="_blank">event sourcing</a>
to store the changes that build up its current state.
</p>

<p>
Look at how the different messages are handled and note the similarities.
An event sourced actor typically follows these steps when receiving a message:
</p>

<ol>
<li>validate the incoming message</li>
<li>create a domain event that represents the state change, and store it with <code>persist</code></li>
<li>update the actor's state inside the <code>persist</code> block, which is invoked after successful storage</li>
<li>do external side effects inside the <code>persist</code> block</li> 
</ol>

<p>
Note that if the JVM crashes right after successful storage the side effect in the last
step is never executed even though the event has been stored.
</p>
 
<p>
For some use cases you may want to do external side effects before persisting the
domain events, with the risk that the side effect was performed even though storage
of the event fails.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to encapsulate the state in an immutable class as illustrated
in the <code>Post.State</code> class. It knows how to create a new <code>State</code>
instance when applying the changes represented by domain events. It is important that the
state updates are free from side effect, because they are applied when the actor
is recovered from the persisted events. See <code>receiveRecover</code>.
</p>

<h2>Sharding the Blog Post Actor</h2>

<p>
Open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/BlogApp.scala" class="shortcut">BlogApp.scala</a>.
</p>

<p>
To make the <code>Post</code> actors sharded in the cluster we need to register it to the 
<code>ClusterSharding</code> extension. See <code>ClusterSharding(system).start</code>
in the <code>BlogApp</code>. Descriptions of the parameters can be found in the API
documentation of <code>ClusterSharding</code>. This must be done on all nodes in
the cluster.
</p>

<p>
The sharding is based on a hash function of the <code>postId</code>. That function is
defined in the companion object of the 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post</a>.
The <code>postId</code> is a String representation of a <code>UUID</code>.
</p>

<p>
Open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Bot.scala" class="shortcut">Bot.scala</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Bot</code> actor simulates creation of blog posts by several authors.
</p>

<p>
To send messages to the identifier of the <code>Post</code> actor you need
to send them via the <code>shardRegion</code> actor, which can be retrieved via the 
<code>ClusterSharding</code> extension. The sharding feature knows how to route the
message and it will on demand allocate the <code>Post</code> actors to cluster nodes
and create the actor instances. Exactly how this works under the hood is described in the 
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/contrib/cluster-sharding.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>. 
</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>Listing of Blog Posts</h2>

<p>
Open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/AuthorListing.scala" class="shortcut">AuthorListing.scala</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>AuthorListing</code> actor collects a list of all published post by
a specific author, i.e. one <code>AuthorListing</code> instance for each author.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Persistent</code> <code>PostSummary</code> messages are sent by the 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post</a>
actor when a post is published.
</p>

<p>
<code>AuthorListing</code> is also sharded. It is registered in the 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/BlogApp.scala" class="shortcut">BlogApp</a>
and its region is used in the 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Bot.scala" class="shortcut">Bot</a>. 
It is using a hash function of the <code>author</code>. That function is
defined in the companion object of the 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/AuthorListing.scala" class="shortcut">AuthorListing</a>.
</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>Test</h2>

<p>
A multi-jvm test for the blog application can be found in 
<a href="#code/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/blog/BlogSpec.scala" class="shortcut">BlogSpec.scala</a>.
You can run it from the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab.
</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>Run the Simulation</h2>

<p>
Go to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab to see the running 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/BlogApp.scala" class="shortcut">BlogApp</a>
with the
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Bot.scala" class="shortcut">Bot</a>.
In the log output you should be able to see that new blog posts are created.
</p>

<p>
<code>BlogApp</code> starts three actor systems (cluster members) in the same JVM process. It can be more
interesting to run them in separate processes. <b>Stop</b> the application in the
<a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab and then open three terminal windows.
</p>

<p>
In the first terminal window, start the first seed node with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;path to activator dir&gt;/activator "runMain sample.blog.BlogApp 2551"
</code></pre>

<p>
2551 corresponds to the port of the first seed-nodes element in the configuration. In the log
output you see that the cluster node has been started and changed status to 'Up'.
</p>

<p>
In the second terminal window, start the second seed node with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;path to activator dir&gt;/activator "runMain sample.blog.BlogApp 2552"		
</code></pre>

<p>
2552 corresponds to the port of the second seed-nodes element in the configuration. In the
log output you see that the cluster node has been started and joins the other seed node and
becomes a member of the cluster. Its status changed to 'Up'.
</p>

<p>
Switch over to the first terminal window and see in the log output that the member joined.
So far, the <code>Bot</code> has not been started, i.e. no blog posts are created.
</p>

<p>
In the third terminal window, start one more node with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;path to activator dir&gt;/activator "runMain sample.blog.BlogApp 0"
</code></pre>

<p>
Now you don't need to specify the port number, 0 means that it will use a random available port.
It joins one of the configured seed nodes. Look at the log output in the different terminal
windows.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Bot</code> is started on nodes with port not equal to 2551 or 2552, i.e. now
it has not been started. You should be able to see log output of the <code>Bot</code>
that generates blog posts.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at the logging that is done in 
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post</a>,
<a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/AuthorListing.scala" class="shortcut">AuthorListing</a>
and <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Bot.scala" class="shortcut">Bot</a>.
Identify the corresponding log entries in the 3 terminal windows.
</p>

<p>
Shutdown the node with port 2552 (second terminal window) with <code>ctrl-c</code>.
Observe how the other nodes detect the failure and remove the node from the cluster.
Also note that requests to the <code>AuthorListing</code> for a specific author that
previously was located on the node with port 2552 will be failed over to one of the
other nodes. Look for the log message starting with "Post added to".
</p>

<p>
You can also start even more nodes with the command:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;path to activator dir&gt;/activator "runMain sample.blog.BlogApp 0"
</code></pre>

<p>
For each additional node another <code>Bot</code> is also started.
</p>

<p>
Note that this sample runs the 
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/scala/persistence.html#Shared_LevelDB_journal" target="_blank">shared LevelDB journal</a>
on the node with port 2551. This is a single point of failure, and should not be used in production. 
A real system would use a 
<a href="http://akka.io/community/" target="_blank">distributed journal</a>.
</p>

<p>
The files of the shared journal are saved in the target directory and when you restart
the application the state is recovered. You can clean the state with:
</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;path to activator dir&gt;/activator clean
</code></pre>

</div>

<h2>Hands-on Exercises</h2>

<p>
Here is a list of improvements to the blog application that you can try yourself:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Enhance the functionality of the event sourced
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post</a> actor.
    Edit title. Change author. Adding and removing comments.</li>
<li>Note that the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Bot.scala" class="shortcut">Bot</a>
    naively assumes that each step of creating, changing and publishing a blog post is succesful.
    If some step fails it will get stuck in the "wrong state". Add acknowlegement messages for the
    operations in the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/Post.scala" class="shortcut">Post</a>
    actor and handle the failure scenarios in the <code>Bot</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html" target="_blank">CQRS</a> query side
    by using a persistent view of the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/blog/AuthorListing.scala" class="shortcut">AuthorListing</a>
    processor.</li>
<li>Replace the
    <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.4/scala/persistence.html#Shared_LevelDB_journal" target="_blank">shared LevelDB journal</a> 
    with a real replicated journal. Pick one
    from the <a href="http://akka.io/community/" target="_blank">community plugins</a>.</li>
</ul>
